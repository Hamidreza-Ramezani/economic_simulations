### Run Classlifting-Examples
Make sure to run the code with enough stack size, otherwise you will get a StackOverflowError. 
You can set this paramter for example in Intellij by putting -Xss128m (128MB Stack size) at VM configuration in the 
configuration settings.

At the moment it is important to build squid locally before using this code. Since there is no public release with
the bug fixes. 

### Code Format

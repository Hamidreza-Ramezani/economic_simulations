This example uses mutable parameter reference. 

Expected output: 
```
(TIMER,0)
Current temperature of the molecule is 100.0
Current temperature of the molecule is 20.0
(TIMER,1)
Current temperature of the molecule is 100.0
Current temperature of the molecule is 60.0
(TIMER,2)
Current temperature of the molecule is 100.0
Current temperature of the molecule is 80.0
(TIMER,3)
Current temperature of the molecule is 100.0
Current temperature of the molecule is 90.0
(TIMER,4)
Current temperature of the molecule is 100.0
Current temperature of the molecule is 95.0
(TIMER,5)
Current temperature of the molecule is 100.0
Current temperature of the molecule is 97.5
(TIMER,6)

This example demonstrates the behavior of stateless merged examples. 

Expected output: 
```
(TIMER,0)

Name is object 2 Age is 5
(TIMER,1)
Name is object 1 Age 6
Name is object 2 Age is 10
(TIMER,2)
Name is object 1 Age 7
Name is object 2 Age is 15
(TIMER,3)
Name is object 1 Age 8
Name is object 2 Age is 20
(TIMER,4)
Name is object 1 Age 9
Name is object 2 Age is 25
...
```
